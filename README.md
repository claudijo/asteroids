# Asteroids

Simple (~30KB) proof of concept Asteroids game with zero third party dependencies... Just built using handcrafted linear algebra, native Web APIs, and ❤️ 

The implementation is heavily inspired by the excellent book [Math for Programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/math-for-programmers)
